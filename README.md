 E-Commerce Price Comparison Tool Documentation

1. Introduction  
The E-Commerce Price Comparison Tool is a Python-based application designed to scrape and compare product prices across multiple online platforms like Amazon, Alibaba, Walmart, and eBay. It provides users with real-time price data, trends, and alerts to help them make informed purchasing decisions.

2. Prerequisites  
Ensure the following libraries are installed before running the tool:  
- `pandas`  
- `beautifulsoup4`  
- `selenium`  
- `scrapy`  
- `requests`  
- `plotly` or `chart.js` for visualization  

3. Features  
Key features of the tool include:  
  Multi-Platform Scraping: Extracts product data from various e-commerce websites.  
  Price Tracking and Alerts: Tracks price changes and sends alerts when prices meet user-defined thresholds.  
  Wishlist Management: Allows users to create and manage a list of products they want to track.  
  Data Visualization: Displays price trends and history using interactive charts.  
  Real-Time Data Updates: Provides up-to-date information with frequent data refreshes.  

4. Methodology  

4.1 Data Collection  
The tool uses Selenium and Scrapy to scrape product data from different e-commerce platforms, handling dynamic content loading and pagination.

4.2 Data Parsing  
BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTML content and extract essential details like product name, price, and availability.

4.3 Data Storage  
Data is stored using Pandas DataFrames for easy manipulation and export to formats such as CSV or Excel. The tool avoids using MongoDB and focuses on lightweight local storage.

4.4 Data Visualization  
Visualization libraries like Plotly or Chart.js are used to create interactive graphs showing price trends and comparisons over time.

5. Challenges and Solutions  
  Dynamic Content: Selenium ensures all dynamic content is fully loaded before scraping.  
  Anti-Scraping Mechanisms: Implemented proxy rotation and user-agent switching to avoid detection.  
  Data Inconsistencies: Developed error-handling mechanisms to deal with missing or incomplete data.  

6. Hosting and Deployment  
The tool can be hosted on platforms like AWS or Heroku for real-time accessibility. Deployment involves setting up a server environment with the necessary scraping and data processing tools.

7. Conclusion  
The E-Commerce Price Comparison Tool provides an efficient way to compare prices across multiple online platforms. Future improvements could include AI-based recommendation systems and enhanced user interfaces for better user experience.
